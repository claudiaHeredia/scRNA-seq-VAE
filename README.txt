The accuracy in classifying cell types and the biological interpretation of
learned patterns are crucial for advancing our understanding of cellular
heterogeneity and its functional implications. In this study, Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) models were employed to analyze Single-Cell gene expression
data from melanoma. Integrated machine learning techniques with advanced
methods for latent space visualization such as t-SNE, and using libraries like
PyTorch to explore and understand the complexity of these transcriptomic data,
facilitating the identification of biologically relevant patterns and their
contextualization within the framework of cellular biology and oncology.
Three experiments were conducted with different hyperparameter
configurations to optimize the performance of VAE. The final experiment, using a
hidden layer of 256 neurons, a latent dimension of 5, and a learning rate of 0.001,
proved to be the most efficient in terms of stabilizing and converging loss during
training. Despite the achieved progress, there is a recognized need to further
explore hyperparameter optimization and integrate additional information from
biological repositories such as Reactome and Kegg.
This project not only enabled the application of advanced machine learning
techniques in cellular biology but also established a solid foundation for
interdisciplinary research. Integrating detailed biological data and continuously
optimizing hyperparameters are crucial steps for the practical application of
models like VAE in biological and medical studies, thereby deepening our
understanding of cellular heterogeneity and its implications for human health.
